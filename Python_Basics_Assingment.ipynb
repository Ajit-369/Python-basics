        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is easy to read and write. It is used for many things like web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it is popular:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple syntax: Easy to learn and understand, even for beginners.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be used with database as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Versatile: Can be used for many types of projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large community: Lots of support, tutorials, and libraries available.\n",
        "\n",
        "Powerful libraries: Especially useful for data analysis (like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs Python code line by line. It checks each line of code and executes it immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple words:\n",
        "The interpreter helps Python understand and run the code you write.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "When you type a Python program and run it, the interpreter reads it one line at a time and shows the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning and are used to write Python code. You cannot use them as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "if, else, for, while, True, False, def, return, import, class, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple words:\n",
        "These keywords are already built into Python and help in writing commands or logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "Because keywords already have special meanings in Python. Using them as variable names will confuse the interpreter and cause an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability in Python means whether the value of an object (like a list or string) can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "If an object can be changed, it is mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "If it cannot be changed, it is immutable.\n",

        "Mutable: list, dict, set\n",
        "(You can add, remove, or change items.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable: int, float, str, tuple\n",
        "(You cannot change the value once it’s created.)\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple words:\n",
        "Mutability means whether something can be changed or not after making it.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created. This is because lists are designed to be flexible and allow modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, you cannot change their content (you can't add, remove, or modify elements). Tuples are designed to be fixed, providing safety for data that should not be altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why the difference?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are used when you need a collection of items that might change during the program's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are used for data that should stay constant, ensuring that no one can accidentally modify the data.\n",

        "- Logical operators in Python are used to combine multiple conditions and return True or False based on the logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 3 main logical operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "and Returns True if both conditions are true\n",

        "\n",

        "In simple words:\n",

        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- As comes in word! type stands for datatypes and casting stands for convertion.\n",
        "Type casting in Python means converting one data type into another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "Converting a number to a string:\n",

        "Done automatically by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Happens when Python safely converts one type to another.\n",

        "2.Explicit Type Casting\n",
        "Done manually by the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "You write the function to convert the type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit = Python does it by itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit = You tell Python to do it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple words:\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to let the program make decisions and run different code based on certain conditions.\n",

        "Common conditional statements:\n",

        "- The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\". It is used to check multiple conditions one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",

        "\n",
        "If it's True, it runs that block and skips the rest.\n",
        "\n",

        "You can have many elif conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "If none are true, the else block (if present) runs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Login System:\n",
